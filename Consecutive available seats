Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

seat_id	free
1	1
2	0
3	1
4	1
5	1
Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

seat_id
3
4
5



Query: 

select distinct c1.seat_id from cinema c1 join cinema c2 on c1.seat_id >=c2.seat_id+1 and c1.free=1 and c2.free=1 join cinema c3 on c1.seat_id>=c3.seat_id+2 and c3.free=1
