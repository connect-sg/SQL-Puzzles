A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The studentsâ€™ location information are stored in table student as below.

name	continent
Jack	America
Pascal	Europe
Xi	Asia
Jane	America
Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.


 
For the sample input, the output is:

America	Asia	Europe
Jack	Xi	Pascal
Jane		
Follow-up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, can you write a query to generate the student report?



query : 
select a.name as America, b.name as europe,c.name as Asia from
(select name,row_number() over(order by name) as cnta from student where continent='America')  as a 
full join 
(select name, row_number() over(order by name) as cntb  from student where continent ='europe') b on a.cnta=b.cntb
full join 
(select name, row_number() over(order by name) as cntc from student where continent ='Asia') c on b.cntb=c.cntc
