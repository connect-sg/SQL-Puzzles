Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: uid, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

uid means user id; action has these kind of values: “show”, “answer”, “skip”; answer_id is not null when action column is “answer”, while is null for “show” and “skip”; q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.


 
Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input:

uid	action	question_id	answer_id	q_num	timestamp
5	show	285	null	1	123
5	answer	285	124124	1	124
5	show	369	null	2	125
5	skip	369	null	2	126
Output:

survey_log
285
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.

Note: The highest answer rate meaning is: answer number’s ratio in show number in the same question.

Query:

select c.username, c.activity, c.startdate, c.enddate from useractivity c join (
select b.username,min(b.startdate) as startdate
from (
select a.username, 
       a.activity,
       a.startdate,
       a.endDate
from useractivity a
where 2 >= (select count(activity) from useractivity 
                                  where startDate>=a.startDate and username = a.username) )b
								  group by b.username) d
								  on c.username=d.username and c.startdate=d.startdate
          
          OR

select b.question_id from 
(select question_id,count(*) as anscnt from survey_log where action ='answer' group by question_id) a
 join 
(select question_id, count(*) as cnt from survey_log group by question_id ) b on a.question_id =b.question_id;

OR 

select a.question_id from (
select top 1 question_id,sum(case when action ='answer' then 1 end)*100.0/sum(case when action='show' then 1 end)  as ans_rate from survey_log 
group by question_id order by ans_rate desc ) a
