Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one.


 
A user canâ€™t perform more than one activity at the same time. Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.



Query:
--create table useractivity(username varchar(50), activity varchar(50), startDate date, endDate date)
--insert into useractivity
--values
--('Alice','Travel','2020-02-12','2020-02-20'),
--('Alice','Dancing','2020-02-21','2020-02-23'),
--('Alice','Travel','2020-02-24','2020-02-28'),
--('Bob','Travel','2020-02-11','2020-02-18')


with cte as (
select u1.username, u1.activity, u1.startdate, u1.enddate from useractivity u1 
where 2=(select count(startdate) from useractivity where username = u1.username and startdate>=u1.startdate)
)

select * from useractivity where username not in (select username from cte) 
union 
select * from cte


OR 


select u.username, 
       u.activity,  
	   u.startDate, 
	   u.endDate from useractivity u 
	   join (
					select username, 
					max(startdate) as startdate, 
					max(endDate) as endDate
					from useractivity 
					where startDate not in  (select case when count(username)!=1 then max(startdate) 
					                                else '01/01/1900' end as sdate 
													from useractivity 
													group by username)
					group by username ) b
		on u.username=b.username and 
		u.startDate=b.startDate and 
		u.endDate=b.endDate
