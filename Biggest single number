able number contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.

Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.


 
num
8
8
3
3
1
4
5
6
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:

num
6
Note;
If there is no such number, just output null.

Query:
select MAX(a.NUM) FROM (
SELECT NUM  
FROM NUMBER 
GROUP BY NUM
HAVING COUNT(NUM)=1 ) a


OR

select max(a.num) from (
                      select num, count(num) as cnt from number 
					  group by num) a
					  
OR 

select top 1 num from number group by num having count(num)<2 order by num desc 
                  where cnt=1;
