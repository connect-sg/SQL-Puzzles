In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a SQL query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.


 
For example:

followee	follower
A	B
B	C
B	D
D	E
Input Data
should output:

follower	num
B	2
D	1
Output Data
Explanation: Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B’s follower is C and D, and D’s follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.

Note:

Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
Please display the result in follower’s alphabet order

Query:
select * from follow;
select followee,count(follower) from follow 
       where followee in (select follower from follow ) 
	   group by followee
